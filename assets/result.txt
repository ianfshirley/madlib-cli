Make Me A Video Game!

I, the stinky and bold Karl have twerked Avienda's
beautiful sister and plan to steal her terrible ears!

What are a elephant and backpacking cat to do? Before you can help Sarah,
you'll have to collect the ugly toads and fat cats that open up the
4 worlds connected to A Ian's Lair. There are 6 trees and 87
lights in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
